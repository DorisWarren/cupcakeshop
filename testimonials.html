    <h1>What people are saying about Martian Cupcake lyfe:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Johnny Cash - "These cupcakes are life changing! After years of being a helpless/hopeless drunk i had one martian cake and it sent to a wonderful state of being that made me realize i was wasting my life away on meaningless things. I make great music that brings beautiful people into my life. I will forever cherish the moment i took a bite of these Martian Cupcakes!!  "</li>

      <li>Bob Saget - "After Full House stopped airing, I sank into a deep depression.  I had no idea what to do with myself now that my identity as the loveable Danny Tanner was over.  After years of therapy, pilates, dieting, and silent meditation retreats, my depression was finally cured through the ecstatic experience of ingesting these succulent Martian creations.  I now volunteer at the local homeless shelter and share Martian cupcakes with everyone I meet."</li>

      <li>Brittany Murphy- "Let me just say i am now the happiest i have ever been. I used to have an addiction to pills so i can numb the pain i felt inside. Needless to say that lead to my death..Fantasic right? I am now taking up residency in Marz where i am treated like a queen.
